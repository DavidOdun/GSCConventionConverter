# GSCConventionConverter

This a simple program that adjusts coding conventions from one coding style to another.

For the nit-picky programmers that prefer camelCase to under_score coding style conventions. We have create a simple coding utility that transforms underscore coding text to camel case. 

How to use it: ./gsc -c [TEXTFILE]
 
Output: To STDOUT and the text file.

The -u flag would be to convert from underscore to camel case but it has not yet been implemented. Feel free to improve this simple code to your liking.
